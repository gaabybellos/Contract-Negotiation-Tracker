## Idea 1: Corporate Brutalism

<text>
**Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalist Corporate — Raw, honest, utilitarian design that prioritizes function while maintaining visual interest through bold typography and stark contrasts.

**Core Principles**:
1. Unapologetic structure — Grid lines visible, no hiding the skeleton
2. Typography as architecture — Large, bold headings create visual hierarchy
3. Functional honesty — Every element serves a purpose, no decorative fluff
4. High contrast for scannability — Dark text on light backgrounds, clear delineation

**Color Philosophy**: 
- Primary: Deep charcoal (#1a1a1a) for authority and seriousness
- Background: Warm off-white (#f8f6f3) to soften the brutalist edges
- Accent: Burnt orange (#c45a2c) for actions and highlights — conveys urgency without alarm
- Status colors: Muted versions (sage green for agreed, slate blue for discussion, terracotta for blocked)
- Emotional intent: Conveys professionalism, trustworthiness, and no-nonsense efficiency

**Layout Paradigm**: 
- Asymmetric two-column master layout with fixed left sidebar (240px)
- Main content uses a strict 12-column grid with visible gutters
- Tables span full width with generous row heights
- Forms positioned in slide-out panels from the right edge

**Signature Elements**:
1. Thick black borders (3px) around interactive cards
2. Monospace numerals in tables for alignment
3. Oversized section labels rotated 90° on left margins

**Interaction Philosophy**: 
- Instant feedback — no waiting animations
- Click states with inverted colors (black → white)
- Hover reveals additional actions in-place, no tooltips

**Animation**: 
- Minimal, purposeful transitions (150ms max)
- Slide-in panels from edges (not center modals)
- No bouncing, no easing — linear movements only
- Tables sort with instant swap, no fade

**Typography System**:
- Headings: Space Grotesk Bold (700) — geometric, modern, authoritative
- Body: IBM Plex Sans Regular (400) — highly readable, technical feel
- Data/Tables: IBM Plex Mono — perfect alignment for numbers and codes
- Scale: 48px/32px/24px/18px/14px/12px
