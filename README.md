## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for basic usage. The app uses browser localStorage for persistence.

### Customizing Impact Categories

Impact categories can be customized in the Settings modal:
1. Click your avatar → Settings
2. Navigate to "Impact Categories"
3. Add, edit, or remove categories and subcategories

### Customizing Owners

Team members (owners) can be added dynamically when creating or editing clauses, or managed in Settings.

---

## 📊 Data Persistence

All data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage:
- **Contracts & Clauses**: `negotiation-tracker-contracts`
- **Templates**: `negotiation-tracker-templates`
- **Playbook Topics**: `negotiation-tracker-playbook`
- **Column Configuration**: `negotiation-tracker-columns`
- **Impact Categories**: `negotiation-tracker-impact-categories`

To export your data for backup, use the Export feature in the contract dropdown menu.

## 🧪 QA AI First Architecture (Technical Delivery)

This repository includes a complete QA architecture built from scratch as part of a technical assessment, adhering strictly to a **QA AI First strategy**.

### Strategy Summary
The core philosophy is **Discovery Before Automation**. Tests are only created after the product features are mapped and traced:
`project-discovery → test-planner → test-generator → test-runner → test-healer`

### Documentation & Governance
- **QA Documentation**: All QA artifacts (specs, plans, module maps, discovery) live centrally in the `Docs/qa` directory.
- **Agent Instructions**: Rules and prompts for AI agents are defined in `AGENTS.md` and located across `.codex/agents/`, `.claude/agents/`, and `skills/`.
- **E2E Framework**: The internal Playwright test repository is fully isolated within `frameworks/ContractTrackerPlaywright/`.
- **Playwright MCP**: Playwright MCP is leveraged by agents specifically for real-time browser inspection, evidence capture, and DOM debugging during test generation and healing. The reproducible execution path relies on the CLI.

### How to Run the Validations

**1. Prepare Environment (pnpm 10.4.1)**
Ensure you have Node.js 18+ and install dependencies with `pnpm 10.4.1` (which is enforced via `packageManager` config).
```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
```

**2. Type Check (Static Analysis)**
```bash
pnpm check
```
*(Note: Expected to fail initially due to known TypeScript interface mismatches in the product source, e.g., `ComparisonModal.tsx` and `sampleData.ts`. This is classified as a product bug and does not block the E2E UI tests.)*

**3. Unit Tests (Vitest)**
```bash
pnpm test
```
Runs isolated tests for pure functions (e.g., `textDiff.test.ts` for comparison statistics logic).

**4. E2E Tests (Playwright)**
First, ensure the Playwright framework dependencies and browsers are installed:
```bash
cd frameworks/ContractTrackerPlaywright
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
cd ../..
```
Then, execute the E2E suite against the local development environment:
```bash
# Starts the Vite dev server and runs the Playwright suite automatically
pnpm pw:test
```

### Current Coverage Summary
- **Unit (`CNT-CMP-001`)**: Text diff computation (additions, removals, changes).
- **E2E (`CNT-CTR-001`)**: Contract CRUD and `localStorage` persistence survival across page reloads.
- **E2E (`CNT-CLA-001` & `CNT-CMP-001`)**: 3-Text clause model validation, save cycle, and the visual comparison modal diffing.

### Known Limitations
- The product codebase contains TypeScript strict mode violations that currently fail `pnpm check`.
- State mutation relies purely on `localStorage`. The E2E suite handles this via the `clearLocalStorage` utility to prevent test state pollution.
- Mobile/Responsive UI tests and advanced module flows (Templates, Filters, Playbook) are documented in the backlog but not yet automated.
